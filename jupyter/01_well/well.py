# ## Two electrons in a well
# 
# Now that's been quite a slog to get through all that theory, it'll be nice to bring the equations to life by actually running iDEA. We'll focus on the physics going on and won't worry too much about how iDEA is solving the equations under the hood.
# 
# We start by investigating the electronic ground state of two electrons sitting in a harmonic well.
# Let's define our external potential $V_{ext}(r)$.

# In[10]:


# Let's define our external potential
omega = 0.25   # resonance frequency in atomic units
def harmonic_well(x):
    return 1/2 * omega**2 * x**2

# and plot it
import numpy as np
x = np.linspace(-10,10,100)

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(x, harmonic_well(x), '--')
plt.xlabel("x [a.u.]")
plt.ylabel(r"$V_{ext}(x)$ [a.u.]")
plt.show()


# Now we'll fill $N=2$ electrons into the system and use the iDEA code to find the exact solution to the time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation
# 
# $$\begin{equation}\left(-\frac{1}{2} \sum_i \frac{\partial^2}{\partial r_i^2} + V_{ext}(r_i) + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i\neq j}v(r_i-r_j) \right) \Psi(r_1,r_2) = E \Psi(r_1,r_2)\end{equation}$$

# This plot illustrates a few things interesting things about the theory. 
# 
# Firstly we can see that the non-interacting electron approximation gets the rough shape of the potential right. However, the electron's are more likely to be found near the centre of the well since they prefer to be in regions of low potential, and don't have Coulomb interaction pushing them away from each other. 
# 
# We also see that the LDA does a very good job, almost perfectly recovering the exact case. 

# Now, in Kohn-Sham density functional theory, the task is to find the Kohn-Sham potential $V_{KS}(r)$ such that the solution of the Kohn-Sham equations
# 
# $$\begin{equation} \left(-\frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2}+V_{KS}(r)\right) \psi_i(r) = i \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \psi_i(r)
# \end{equation}$$
# 
# yields the same density. Since we already know the exact $n(r)$, the task reduces to an optimisation problem. Try to optimize the Kohn-Sham potential to bring $n_{KS}(r)$ as close as possible to $n(r)$. (TODO: provide code)
