HYB (Hybrid)
============

The HYB code solves the Hybrid DFT equation (containing a linear 
combination of the LDA exchange-correlation potential and Fock 
operators) to approximately calculate the ground state density of a 
one-dimensional finite system of :math:`N` like-spin electrons, with 
Hamiltonian :math:`\hat{T} + \hat{U} + \hat{V}_{\text{ext}}`, where 
:math:`\hat{U}` is the operator for the softened Coulomb interaction 
potential given by 

.. math:: u(x, y) = (1 + |x-y|)^{-1} \, .

A perturbing potential may be applied to the ground state system, and 
the time-dependent Hybrid DFT equation solved approximately to 
calculate the system's time evolution.

Calculating the ground state
----------------------------

Orbitals and corresponding non-degenerate 
energy eigenvalues :math:`\{ \varphi_{j}, \varepsilon_{j} \}_{j=1}^{N}` 
for a non-interacting system of :math:`N` electrons are first 
calculated from the single-particle Schr√∂dinger equation with 
Hamiltonian :math:`\hat{T} + \hat{V}_{\text{ext}}`.

We then proceed to calculate the ground state electron density of this 
system:

.. math:: n(x) = \sum_{j=1}^{N} \lvert \varphi_{j}(x) \rvert ^{2} \, .

From this we find the Hartree potential

.. math:: v_{\text{H}}(x) = \int \! n(y)u(x,y) \, \mathrm{d}y \, ,

the Fock matrix (the self-energy in the exchange-only approximation)

.. math:: \Sigma_{\text{x}}(x,y) = - \sum_{j=1}^{N} \varphi_{j}^{*}(y) \varphi_{j}(x) u(x,y) \, ,

and the LDA exchange-correlation potential 
:math:`v_{\text{xc}}^{\text{LDA}}` (see iDEA LDA).

Let :math:`\alpha \in \mathopen[ 0, 1 \mathclose]` be a fixed parameter 
which determines the linear mixing of Hartree-Fock and LDA. Then 
defining

.. math:: H_{\alpha}(x,y) = \delta(x-y)\hat{T} + \delta(x-y)v_{\text{ext}}(y) + \delta(x-y)v_{\text{H}}(y) + \alpha\Sigma_{\text{x}}(x,y) + (1-\alpha)\delta(x-y)v_{\text{xc}}^{\text{LDA}}(y) \, ,

the Hybrid Hamiltonian :math:`\hat{H}_{\alpha}` acts via the integral transform

.. math:: \hat{H}_{\alpha}\varphi(x) = \int \! H_{\alpha}(x,y)\varphi(y) \, \mathrm{d}y \, .

When our one-dimensional space is discretized to points on a grid, 
:math:`H_{\alpha}(x,y)` itself is a two-dimensional array with a 
parameter :math:`\alpha`, and acts as the Hamiltonian on the now 
one-dimensional arrays :math:`\{ \varphi_{j} \}_{j=1}^{N}`.

We solve the Hybrid equation

.. math:: \hat{H}_{\alpha}\varphi_{j} = \varepsilon_{j}\varphi_{j}

to obtain a new set of orbitals and their corresponding eigenvalues.

Using these new orbitals the above process is iterated until a 
self-consistent solution is reached (i.e. until the change in the new 
electron density :math:`n` is small enough compared to that of the 
previous iteration).

The parameter :math:`\alpha` may be specified manually, however it is 
also possible to determine an "optimal" value for :math:`\alpha` by 
considering the generalized Koopmans' theorem, which gives conditions 
under which the model best describes a physical system.

Time-dependence
---------------

A perturbing potential :math:`v_{\text{ptrb}}` is added to the 
ground state system so that it now has Hamiltonian 
:math:`\hat{T} + \hat{U} + \hat{V}_{\text{ext}} + \hat{V}_{\text{ptrb}}`.

We construct the Time-Dependent Hybrid Hamiltonian, which again acts 
via the same integral transform as explained previously, but now with 
a perturbation potential term added as

.. math:: H_{\alpha}^{\text{TD}}(x,y) = H_{\alpha}(x,y) + \delta(x-y)v_{\text{ptrb}}(y) \, .

Beginning with the ground state (initial time) orbitals and energies 
:math:`\{ \varphi_{j}(t=0), \varepsilon_{j}(t=0) \}_{j=1}^{N}` as 
already calculated, we apply the Crank--Nicolson method to evolve the 
system forward in time by a step of size :math:`\delta t`:

.. math:: \{ \varphi_{j}(t) \}_{j=1}^{N} \rightarrow \{ \varphi_{j}(t=t+\delta t) \}_{j=1}^{N} \, .

This process is repeated until the desired duration of the 
time-evolution has been simulated. The electron density of the system 
is calculated from the orbitals at each time-step.
