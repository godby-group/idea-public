On these pages we are going to briefly introduce the theory behind the physics
that the iDEA code is trying to unravel. We aim to cover all the essentials,
but if you're looking for more complete treatments, we strongly recommend the
following two books:

1. `Interacting Electrons: Theory and Computational Approaches <http://www.cambridge.org/core_title/gb/288165>`_ by Martin, Reining and Ceperley
2. `Electronic Structure: Basic Theory and Practical Methods <https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjT7qLeorbVAhXRZVAKHcVDD68QFggxMAE&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cambridge.org%2Fcatalogue%2Fcatalogue.asp%3Fisbn%3D9780521534406&usg=AFQjCNEDh2Gpo-R-q2oVnK15gwE58vsuFw>`_ again by Martin

The second book goes into a little more detail on the basics than the first, so might be a
better starting point for beginners.
