The iDEA code (interacting Dynamic Electrons Approach) is a Python-Cython
software suite developed in Rex Godby's group at the University of York since
2010. It has a central role in a number of research projects related to
many-particle quantum mechanics for electrons in matter.

iDEA's main features are:

* Exact solution of the many-particle time-independent Schrödinger equation,
  including exact exchange and correlation
* Exact solution of the many-particle time-dependent Schrödinger equation,
  including exact exchange and correlation
* Simplicity achieved using spinless electrons in one dimension
* An arbitrary external potential that may be time-dependent
* Optimisation methods to determine the exact DFT/TDDFT Kohn-Sham potential
  and energy components
* Implementation of various approximate functionals (established and novel) for
  comparison
