You'll find a collection of `jupyter notebooks <http://jupyter.org/>`_ in the
:code:`examples/` subdirectory. Once you've installed iDEA on your computer, you
can run these examples interactively via

.. code-block:: bash

    cd examples/
    jupyter notebook


If you prefer to get a first impression without installing iDEA, 
you find static HTML versions of the examples below.
