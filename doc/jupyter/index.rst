You'll find a few jupyter notebooks in `examples/jupyter`.
Once you've installed iDEA on your computer, you can run these examples
interactively via

.. code-block:: bash

    cd examples/jupyter
    jupyter notebook


If you prefer to get a first impression without installing iDEA, 
you may want to have a look at the static HTML versions of the examples.

.. toctree::

    well.ipynb
    double_well.ipynb
    tunneling_solution.ipynb
